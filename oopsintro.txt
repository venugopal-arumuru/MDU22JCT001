Object Oriented programming strucuture:-
-------------------------------------
it is a programming methodalogy where it will provide security for data. 

Object
Class
Data Encapsulation
Data Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymarphisum

Object :-
---------
Anything in the real world is an object which has some attribute and functionality. 

ex:- 

Car :-  
	Attributes :-
			Car Number, Model, Engine, Seating, 
	Functionality :- 
			Driving
-------------------
Student is an Object

Attributes 
	Rollno, Stdname, gender, class, phonenumber, email, ....
Actions 
	Reg.NewStudent, Modify StudentDetails, Preparing Marks Sheet.

===================================
Class :-  It is an encapsulated cell which meant for defining attributes and functionalities for an object. 

class  <class name>
{
	variables (data)

	methods (user defined functions)
}


class TestClass
{
	int x, y;  // data (class variables)
	
	void getdata()
	{
		x = 10;
		y = 20;
	}

	void putdata()
	{
		print(x)
		print(y)
	}
}

Object :-  It is an instance of the class. 

<Classname> <obj> = new <Classname>([parameters]);

one class object(s) will be created in another class or within the same class if that class having main() method.

Once object is created, we can access class members(variables and methods) with the help of object as follows
	Object.classmember_name	

TestClass tc1 = new TestClass();
tc1.getdata();
tc1.putdata();
----------------------------
